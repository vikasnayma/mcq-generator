    Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process complex computations at incredible speeds. Unlike classical 
    computers, which use bits as binary units, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, 
    enabling parallel processing and solving problems previously deemed unsolvable. However, quantum computing faces challenges like error correction, 
    high costs, and maintaining stable qubits. If successfully developed, quantum computers could revolutionize fields like cryptography, 
    drug discovery, and artificial intelligence.
